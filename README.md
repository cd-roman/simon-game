# simon-game
Simon is an electronic game of a short-term memory skill. It creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails, the game is over.

You can play it here:

Don't forget to turn on background music using a button at the bottom right corner to add some retro mood.

Enjoy!
